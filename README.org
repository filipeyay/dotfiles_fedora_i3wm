* My simple i3wm configuration for a Fedora post install.
** Intruduction:
 This is just a simple configuration for the i3 tiling window manager. I got tired of how Gnome works and tried to do my best to make a configuration that is simple, minimal and just works. Just keep in mind that I have only tested this on Fedora, but is so simple it should work on any distribution.

* Dependecies:
** To keep it simple and functional you must install:
 * i3 (The tiling window manager)
 * i3blocks (A bar with scripts)
 * picom (A compositor to fix screen tearing)
 * feh (To set cool wallpapers)
 * rofi (To launch applications and launch power menu)
 * dunst (Notification)
 * A terminal emulator (Pick what you like the most, I use Alacritty)

** My bloat:
 * thunar (File manager)
 * htop (System monitor)
 * redshift (Night light)
 * lxappearance (Change gtk and icon themes + Change applications fonts)
 * Spacemacs (Text editor + Note taking with org-mode)
 * mpv (Video player)
 * rhythmbox (Music player)
 * fille-roller (Archive manager (unzip ,unrar ,etc)
