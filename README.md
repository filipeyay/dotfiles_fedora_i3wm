# My simple i3wm configuration.
 ## Intruduction:
 This is my simple configuration for the i3 tiling window manager, hopefully it is possible to work out of the box with any linux distribution. But just keep in mind that I have only tested on Fedora.

# Dependecies:
## To make it simple you must install:

i3 (The tiling window manager)

i3blocks (The bar)

picom (Compositor)

feh (To set the wallpaper)

rofi (To launch applications and launch power menu)

dunst (Notification)

A terminal emulator (I recommend Alacritty or Kitty)

-------------------
## The add-ons I like to use:

pcmanfm or thunar (File manager)

htop (System Monitor)

redshift (Night Light)

lxappearance (Change Theme + Application Fonts)

spacemacs or neovim (Text editor)

mpv (Video player)

rhythmbox (Music player)

xarchiver (Archive manager front-end)

## Hope you enjoy it.
